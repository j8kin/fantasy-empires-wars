/**
 * Test for MainView Game Initialization Logic
 *
 * This test verifies the critical bug fix in MainView.tsx lines 78-99 where
 * the gameInitializedRef flag was preventing new games from starting their first turn.
 *
 * The issue was that when starting a new game with a different map size,
 * the MainView component wouldn't detect it as a new game and wouldn't call startNewTurn().
 *
 * The fix uses a game state fingerprint to detect when a truly new game has started.
