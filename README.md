## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/j8kin/fantasy-empires-wars.git
cd fantasy-empires-wars
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The application will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will automatically reload when you make changes.

### Building for Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory, optimized for deployment.

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

This launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Tests will re-run automatically when files change.

### Code Formatting

Format code with Prettier:

```bash
npm run format
# or
yarn format
```

Check code formatting:

```bash
npm run format-check
# or
yarn format-check
```

### Deployment

Deploy to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
# or
yarn deploy
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
